## Project Description

Project API: [Prince George's County Speeding Cameras](https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/resource/mnkf-cu5c)

### Project Goal

We want to use this project to help drivers get an awareness of where speeding cameras are located, at least within Prince George’s County. Although navigation apps like Google Maps and Waze provide indications of cameras, those are dependent on crowdsourcing whereas the dataset we chose is provided directly by the Prince George’s County police department making it much more reliable.

### Visualizations

- Leaflet.js - Used the open-source Leaflet.js Library to create a Map visualization for our project which would display the filtered list of speeding cameras with clear markers

### CSS Frameworks

- Bulma.css - Used the open-source Bulma.css Stylesheet to create a visually-appealing interface for our website and replaced our original style.css completely with better design and smoother navigation
